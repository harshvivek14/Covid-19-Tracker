# Covid-19-Tracker


Covid-19 Tracker is an app which tells us about the Coronavirus in brief. The Covid-19 Tracker also has an assessment tool which takes some inputs from the user and as per the inputs provided by the user, it shows the risk level of getting affected by the virus. It also tells us the neccesary precautions to be taken, at the end of every test.
The Covid-19 Tracker also gives us the statistic of the covid cases (active, recovered, deaths) all around the world (200+ countries) with a nice and smooth graph.
